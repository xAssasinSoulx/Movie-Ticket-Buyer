# Movie-Ticket-Buyer
This is a very basic login and registering system which uses database connection -which in this case I used MySQL and phpMyAdmin- by the way I used localhost so it won't work on your computer.
The user has the chance of resetting his password and the program will check for already registered usernames and if the user wants to
take one of the usernames that are being used, the program won't give permission and will ask the user for a new username.
